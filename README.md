## Raspberry Pi Emulator

The **ESPuno Pi Zero**, is a pin compatible Raspberry Pi ESP32 Controller and Emulator in a single board.  

The Raspberry Pi GPIO's are controlled and driven from the ESP32-C6 and GPIO Expander, so bringing Raspberry Pi PiHat's and Breakout boards to the Arduino Embedded controller world.

## Differences between the 2 different antenna types on the ESPuno Pi Zero?

Both versions of the board are functionally exactly the same. However, depending on your eventual application, you require different wireless functionality and ranges.

### ESPuno Pi Zero (Standard PCB Antenna)

This is ideal for local projects that are for example, in the home or office. All relatively local the the wireless access point or router.

### ESPuno Pi Zero (U.FL Antenna)

This variant is intended for projects where you may put the **ESPuno Pi Zero** board in a metal enclosure, or need greater range to the wireless access point or router.

The small pigtail U.FL IPEX/MHF4 to SMA Female cable can be chassis, or enclosure, mounted, so allowing you to attach the small antenna away from the board, or connect low loss coax to another external antenna.
